# DSA Virtual Lab
A full-stack web application designed to demystify Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through an interactive and engaging learning experience.

About the Project
The DSA-Mastery Platform is a full-stack web application designed to help developers and students master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Our goal is to create an interactive and intuitive learning environment that simplifies complex concepts through visualizations, practice problems, and detailed explanations.

This project began as a foundational clone of a successful learning platform (https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html). We've identified several areas for improvement, and we're looking for passionate developers to help us build a more robust, efficient, and user-friendly application.

üöÄ Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: Watch data structures like trees and graphs come to life, making it easier to understand how they work.
Conceptual Guides: Access clear, concise explanations for every topic.

üíª Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML , CSS, JS, React
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

(This is a suggested tech stack. The actual stack can be decided by the contributors.)

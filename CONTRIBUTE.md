## ‚öôÔ∏è The Contribution Process

### 1. Find an Issue or Create a New One
* **Look for existing issues**: Check the [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/dsa-mastery-platform/issues) tab for a list of open tasks. We use labels like `good first issue` to help newcomers get started.
* **Create a new issue**: If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature, please open a new issue.
    * **Bug Report**: Provide a clear title, steps to reproduce the bug, and your environment details.
    * **Feature Request**: Clearly describe the feature, why it's useful, and any potential implementation ideas.

### 2. Fork and Clone the Repository
* Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
* Clone the repository locally: `git clone (https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab)`

### 3. Create a New Branch
* Always create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/add-binary-tree-visualization
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-error
    ```

### 4. Make Your Changes
* Write your code, update documentation, or create tests.
* Ensure your code adheres to our [Technical Requirements](#technical-requirements) section below.
* Commit your changes with a clear, concise message. Follow the conventional commit format if possible (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`).

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
* Push your branch to your forked repository.
* Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.
* In your PR description, explain your changes, mention the issue it addresses (e.g., "Closes #123"), and include screenshots or GIFs if applicable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
* **Coding Style**: We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent code formatting. Please run `npm run format` before submitting your PR.
* **Tests**: All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by relevant tests.
* **Environment**: Ensure your code runs correctly in a modern browser and follows the project's tech stack guidelines.

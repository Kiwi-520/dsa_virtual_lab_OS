## üéØ What is this Project?
The **DSA Virtual Lab** is a full-stack web application designed to help developers and students master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Inspired by successful platforms like the [USFCA DSA Visualization page](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html), our goal is to create an interactive and intuitive learning environment that simplifies complex concepts through visualizations and detailed explanations.

## ‚ú® Why is it Useful?
Learning DSA is a critical step for anyone pursuing a career in software development. This platform aims to make that journey less intimidating and more effective by:
* **Demystifying Complex Concepts**: Our interactive visualizations turn abstract algorithms into visual, easy-to-understand processes.
* **Providing a Hands-On Approach**: The platform will feature a wide range of interactive modules to hone your skills.
* **Building a Community**: We believe that learning is a collaborative process. Our open-source model encourages contributions and shared knowledge to build a robust and user-friendly application.

## üöÄ Key Features
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch data structures like trees and graphs come to life, making it easier to understand how they work.
* **Conceptual Guides**: Access clear, concise explanations for every topic.
* **Problem-Solving Modules**: A curated list of DSA problems with a built-in code editor, test cases, and solutions (Future plans).
* **User Progress Tracking**: Monitor progress through solved problems and mastered concepts (Future plans).

## üíª Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
*(This is a suggested tech stack. The actual stack can be decided by the contributors.)*

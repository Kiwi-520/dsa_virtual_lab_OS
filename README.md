## üéØ What is this Project?
The **DSA Virtual Lab** is a full-stack web application designed to help developers and students master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Inspired by successful platforms like the [USFCA DSA Visualization page](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html), our goal is to create an interactive and intuitive learning environment that simplifies complex concepts through visualizations and detailed explanations.

## ‚ú® Why is it Useful?
Learning DSA is a critical step for anyone pursuing a career in software development. This platform aims to make that journey less intimidating and more effective by:
* **Demystifying Complex Concepts**: Our interactive visualizations turn abstract algorithms into visual, easy-to-understand processes.
* **Providing a Hands-On Approach**: The platform will feature a wide range of interactive modules to hone your skills.
* **Building a Community**: We believe that learning is a collaborative process. Our open-source model encourages contributions and shared knowledge to build a robust and user-friendly application.

## üöÄ Key Features
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch data structures like trees and graphs come to life, making it easier to understand how they work.
* **Conceptual Guides**: Access clear, concise explanations for every topic.
* **Problem-Solving Modules**: A curated list of DSA problems with a built-in code editor, test cases, and solutions (Future plans).
* **User Progress Tracking**: Monitor progress through solved problems and mastered concepts (Future plans).

## üíª Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
*(This is a suggested tech stack. The actual stack can be decided by the contributors.)*

## ü§ù How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! Whether you're a seasoned full-stack engineer or a student looking to gain experience, there's a place for you here.

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Clone your forked repository**: `git clone https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab.git`
3.  **Explore the issues**. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab/issues) section for existing bugs, feature requests, or enhancements.
4.  **Create a new issue**. If you find a bug or have an idea, open a new issue with a clear description.
5.  **Start coding**. Comment on an issue to let others know you're working on it.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**. Once your changes are ready, submit a PR to the `main` branch. Please provide a clear title and description of your changes, referencing the issue it addresses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Git installed on your system.
-   Node.js installed on your system.
-   A code editor like VS Code.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab.git](https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd dsa_virtual_lab
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the development server, and the application will be available in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîÑ Keeping Your Fork Up to Date

To ensure your forked repository stays in sync with the original `dsa_virtual_lab` project, follow these steps:

1.  **Add the Original Repository as a Remote (`upstream`)**:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream [https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab.git](https://github.com/maheshRudra2025/dsa_virtual_lab.git)
    ```

2.  **Fetch the Latest Changes from the Original Repository**:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

3.  **Merge Changes into Your Local `main` Branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    ```

4.  **Push the Updated `main` Branch to Your Fork**:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Resolving Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts can occur when changes on the remote branch conflict with your local changes. Here‚Äôs a simple process to resolve them:

1.  **Fetch and Merge the `upstream` Branch**:
    * Follow the steps above to run `git fetch upstream` and `git merge upstream/main`. This will show you which files have conflicts.

2.  **Open the Conflicted Files**:
    * Your code editor will highlight the conflicts. A conflict is marked by special Git markers:
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Your local changes
    =======
    Incoming changes from upstream
    >>>>>>> upstream/main
    ```

3.  **Manually Edit the Files**:
    * Carefully review the conflicting code and decide which version to keep. You can choose to keep your changes, the incoming changes, or a combination of both.
    * **Delete the Git markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)** after you've resolved the conflict.

4.  **Stage the Resolved Files**:
    ```bash
    git add <path/to/conflicted/file>
    ```

5.  **Complete the Merge**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
    ```

6.  **Push Your Changes**:
    * Once all conflicts are resolved and committed, you can push your local branch to your fork.
